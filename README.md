# Welcome to Curtain_Penny - Smart Home Project
This project is for fun...
Feather Huzzah ESP8266 and TMC2100 are the main components for this project.
This program integrates Alexa/Amazon app to automate open and close curtain operation.
Some of the variables are for testing purposes only and need to be adjusted accordingly.
It is a working progress...
